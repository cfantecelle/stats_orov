# Statistics for the OROV paper

Companion repository to ensure analysis reproducibility of the paper submitted.

### List of files

`OROV_Cytokines.xlsx` = Contains the tables with and without outliers. In the tables with outliers, the outliers are in red, bold text.

`orov_v2.R` = Analysis script containing every code needed to reproduce the analyses and plots in the paper.

<small>Observation: Outliers were detected using ROUT (Q = 1%) method in GraphPad Prism. The test simply reports which values are outliers and which are not (already flagged in the spreadsheet), which is why there is no export file from Prism with the associated results.</small>
